# [Four shells](https://4shells.com)

Four Shells is a community-driven [Free and Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS) project that brings to the world two things:

- [NixDB](https://4shells.com/nixdb): Database with Nix packages from all versions, all commits and all channels.
- [CachIPFS](https://4shells.com/cachipfs): Encrypted Nix binary cache over IPFS.

We are deployed at [4shells.com](https://4shells.com), docs, contributing and developing guidelines are [there](https://4shells.com/docs), too.

See you there!
